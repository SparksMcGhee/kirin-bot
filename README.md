# Kiran: Ad-Block for the post-human internet 
AI, bots, enshitification, and attention-maximizing algorythms are runing the internet. 

We can't turn back time and make these things go away, but we can pit fire against fire.

It's a bot, written by bots, to filter out bots. Clearly this is the best timeline. 

# How does Kiran work? 
Kiran *fights for the user*: You tell Kiran what you care about and Kiran tells you when that comes up in your socials. Full stop. No advertisers tipping the scale to sell you shit, no data scientists optimizing feeds for addiction, no evil recomendation algorythm, no enshitification, no notification blitz when your friends start blasting memes at 2am (unless of course Kiran knows you'd want in).  

Kiran *only watches*: It will never spam or bother your friends, humiliate you, or otherwise contribute to the problems it exists to solve. At-most it will reach out to you privately when it thinks you should know something. 

You *own your data*: Data you feed Kiran is still yours. All data it collects never leaves your direct ownership and soverenty. It is designed to run entirely on self-hosted equipment. 

# Why does Kiran need to exist?

For most of human history the biggest challenge we faced was getting enough food, so we wired ourselves to consume all the greese, salt, carbs, and sugar we could cram into our mouths. 

Then, in an evolutionary blink of the eye the whole game changed. Developed nations didn't just have enough food, we had too much food. Suddenly the biggest killer and threat to our wellbeing wasn't starving, it was obesity, diabetes, and heart problems... suddenly success wasn't eating enough, it was eating right. 

It took us years of experimenting with scientific reserch, fad diets, public education campaigns, regulation, and finally GLP-1 drugs to functionally patch our brain's wiring.

For most of human history most of humanity's brains figuratively starved. Our natural curiosity and need for knowledge and closeness was perpetually scratching for every tidbit. 

Then, in an evolutionary blink of the eye the whole game changed. Suddenly the Internet allowed us to hook a firehose of all humanitites knowledge along with every banial thought and infinite volumes of empty mental junkfood directly up to our eyeballs. Suddenly becoming wise, informed, and connected wasn't simply consuming enough information.... it was consuming the right information. 

Fad information diets (cutting social media), public information campaigns, regulation, all that barely moved the needle for food, there's little reason to think it's going to move the needle here either. What about our GLP-1 moment? Part of it already happened in the 90s with Ad and Popup blocking, but now in today's internet the junkfood isn't ~next to~ the content anymore... it's ~IN~ the content. 

That's right, fatty information isn't like a fatty hamburger. If the resturants won't sell you a low-fat info-burger then you can use filtering to leave the fat on the plate. "Thank you for the blog post sir, I'll savor it... but you can keep the Ads." 

Kiran exists to be the Ad-block of the post-human internet. 

# How does it work? Its major functionality is: 
- Virtual Android? 
    - Running a virtual Android phone and just using ingesting the notification feed. Potential end-run around anti-bot detection.
    - Not all modules will need it. 
- Pluggable modules for ingesting data from various feeds 
- NodeJS engine for processing posts and checking interst allignment in real-time 
- Relational database storing memories of things it's user wants and doesn't want
- Dream system for processing user instructions and memories into interests 
- GUI Interface (web app which can be added home screens)

# Why "Kiran"? 
Kiran means :giraffe: in Japanese!

It also means "ray of light" in sanskrit and "dark-haired" in Gaelic.
